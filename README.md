This is a simple and easy-to-use project for converting files between different formats, such as:
 PDF ↔ Word  or  PNG ↔ JPEG  

The project uses an online file conversion service (for example, CloudConvert).  
To use this application you only need to get an API key from any supported platform and add it to the `.env` file.
Once the API key is set correctly, everything else should work smoothly.

How to Run the Project

 Clone the repository  
 Install the required dependencies  
 Create a `.env` file and add your API key  
 Start the server  


 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add:

inside .env : 
CLOUDCONVERT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
